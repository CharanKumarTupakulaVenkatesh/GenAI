Part 2: Generative AI Application Development 

learn to build advanced LLM applications in Databricks using multi-stage reasoning LLM chains and agents. You'll discover how to:

Decompose problems

Select suitable models

Construct multi-stage reasoning chains

Design autonomous agents using generative models 

Part 3: Generative AI Application Evaluation and Governance 
evaluating and governing generative AI systems. You will:

Explore the meaning and motivation for building evaluation and governance/security systems

Connect them to the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform

Learn various evaluation techniques

Analyze evaluating entire AI systems with respect to performance and cost

Part 4: Generative AI Application Deployment and Monitoring 

 explanation of how to deploy, operationalize, and monitor generative AI applications using tools like Model Serving. We'll cover best practices for operationalizing generative AI applications and explore monitoring using Lakehouse Monitoring.
